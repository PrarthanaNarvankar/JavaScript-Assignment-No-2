    /*  Ans:: The value of clothes[0] comes to be undefined on console because of the
        length attribute has special behaviour as it cut back length.The value of attribute
         has a side effect of deleting elements whose index is between the old and new length
         values.And when clothes.length=0 in the array of clothes all the items have been 
         deleted.As the array is emptied,so the value is undefined.  */
